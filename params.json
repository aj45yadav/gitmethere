  "body": "# GitMeThere\r\n\r\nThis gem is a wrapper for Scott Chacon's [ruby-git](https://github.com/schacon/ruby-git) gem with commands that streamline the process of creating repositories in a given state.  Its primary purpose is for demonstrating common Git scenarios, but it is handy for scripting basic repository operations.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n```\r\n> gem install gitmethere\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nUse this gem to write Ruby scripts that automate repository creation.\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n\r\n# A sample script for generating a repository with a merge-conflict on the horizon.\r\n\r\nrequire 'gitmethere'\r\n\r\nsetup = {\r\n  name: \"merge-conflict\",\r\n  explanation:\r\n    \"# Merge Conflicts\r\n\r\n    This repository demonstrates how merge conflicts occur.\"\r\n}\r\n\r\nscenario = GitMeThere::Scenario.new(name = setup[:name], explanation = setup[:explanation])\r\n\r\nscenario.checkout_branch('feature')\r\n\r\nscenario.append_to_file(\r\n  file=\"README.md\",\r\n  content=\"A feature branch was created off of the `Initial commit`.\r\n        This line was added to the file on the feature branch.\"\r\n)\r\n\r\nscenario.stage_changes\r\n\r\nscenario.commit('Add line to feature branch.')\r\n\r\nscenario.checkout_branch('master')\r\n\r\nscenario.append_to_file(\r\n  file=\"README.md\",\r\n  content=\"A feature branch was created off of the initial commit.\r\n        However, work on `master` progressed in parallel to the work on `feature`.\r\n        Since both branches contain commits after their common ancestor, the `master` and `feature` branches have now diverged.\r\n        This is not always a problem, but since the same line (this line) was modified on both branches, Git does not know which version is the correct one.\r\n        At this point, if you try to merge `feature` into `master`, you will encounter a merge conflict.\")\r\n\r\nscenario.stage_changes\r\n\r\nscenario.commit('Add line to master branch')\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\n1. Fork it ( https://github.com/loranallensmith/gitmethere/fork )\r\n2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)\r\n3. Write tests for your changes\r\n4. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)\r\n5. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)\r\n6. Make sure all tests are passing\r\n7. Create a new Pull Request\r\n",
